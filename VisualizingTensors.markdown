To a programmer, tensors are arrays. To a mathematician, tensors are matrices. To a physicist, tensors are properties. So if we may draw, how would tensors look really?

Tensors are higher dimentional mathematical data structures, using which physical properties can be represented. It's usually difficult to visualize what a tensor might look like when we go beyond 2 or 3 dimentions. <br />

This picture attempts to visualize higher an higher dimention tensors that we humans can perceive easily.
